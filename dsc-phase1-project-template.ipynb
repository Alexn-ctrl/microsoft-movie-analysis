    "\n",
    "Microsoft is planning to launch its own movie studio and wants to select the most profitable genre for their first film. The project's goal is to help Microsoft create a successful movie studio by determining the types of films that are currently successful in the box office.To make this decision, they need to analyze movie production data from different datasets to determine which movies have been the most successful in terms of revenue earned compared to production costs. Based on the analysis, Microsoft can then strategically choose a genre that has the potential to generate the highest profits for their new movie studio."

    "Summary of the business problem you are trying to solve, and the data questions that you plan to answer to solve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business problem is that Microsoft lacks expertise in creating movies and needs to understand what types of films resonate with audiences and are the most profitable.Microsoft should identify the top-selling movies and the types of movies that yield the highest profits in order to maximize returns and compare them against production costs and other expenses in the production line. We shall use exploratory data analysis to generate insights, to identify patterns and predict future market trends. The results are organized by genre, target audience, and other relevant factors. The recommendations will be crucial for data-driven decision-making, as it is essential to understand the total market and profit potential before investing a significant amount of money."

    "* Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?\n",

    "\n",
    "The data represent box office performance, audience preferences, and market trends in the movie industry. The sample for box office data will be all movies released in the past decade, while the sample for audience preference data will be a representative sample of moviegoers. The variables included will depend on the data source, but may include genre, budget, production company, release date, audience demographics, and preference data such as preferred genres, actors, and directors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable will vary depending on the data source and research question. For box office data, the target variable will be revenue or profitability. For audience preference data, the target variable will be the preference for specific genres, actors, or directors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties of the variables we intend to use will depend on the research question and data source. We will need to examine the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and determine if any data cleaning or transformation is necessary. We will also need to consider the quality and completeness of the data and ensure that the data sources are reliable and trustworthy."
